    "# Challenge 7-2: Hiring Assessment Team with AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a multi-agent collaboration system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. We'll create a Hiring Assessment Team that simulates the technical assessment process for candidates, showcasing role specialization and handoffs between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen is a framework from Microsoft Research that enables:\n",
    "- Flexible agent-to-agent communication\n",
    "- Multi-agent collaboration patterns\n",
    "- Function calling and tool use\n",
    "- Dynamic conversation orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates how AutoGen can be used to simulate real-world business processes involving multiple specialized roles with proper handoffs."
