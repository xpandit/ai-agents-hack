    "# Challenge 7-1: Multi-Agent Collaboration with Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a multi-agent collaboration system using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework. We'll create an Employee Onboarding Assistant System where multiple specialized agents work together to provide a seamless experience for new hires.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel is a production-ready SDK (v1.0+ across .NET, Python, and Java) designed for enterprise AI applications. It excels at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enterprise integration with robust security and stability\n",
    "- Plugin architecture for extending functionality\n",
    "- Structured agent development with the Agent Framework\n",
    "- Process orchestration for business workflows\n",
    "- Multi-agent coordination through group chat capabilities\n",
    "- Strong typing and enterprise-grade deployment patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Agent Systems Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems represent the next evolution in AI application design, addressing limitations that single agents face when handling complex, multi-domain tasks. By creating a team of specialized AI agents that can communicate, collaborate, and coordinate their activities, multi-agent systems can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle complex problems by breaking them down into specialized domains\n",
    "- Provide checks and balances through agent debates and verification\n",
    "- Offer more transparent reasoning through explicit agent interactions\n",
    "- Scale to handle broader knowledge and skill domains than any single agent could manage\n",
    "- Mimic human team collaboration for more natural problem-solving approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a multi-agent system using Semantic Kernel's Agent Framework, specifically leveraging the Group Chat functionality to create a team of specialized agents for employee onboarding."

    "\n",
    "First, let's install the necessary packages and set up our environment. For this multi-agent system, we'll need:\n",

    "- **semantic-kernel**: The core framework for building our agents and plugins\n",
    "- **python-dotenv**: For managing API keys and environment variables\n",
    "- **openai**: To interact with OpenAI models (or Azure OpenAI services)\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: For visualization (if needed)\n",

    "4. **Training Plugin**: Provides information about training and development resources\n",

    "## Conclusion: The Power of Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've implemented a sophisticated Employee Onboarding Assistant System using Semantic Kernel's Agent Framework. We demonstrated two different approaches to agent orchestration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Group Chat**: Using a simple termination strategy with a coordinator agent\n",
    "2. **Smart Selection Strategy**: Using the KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy to route conversations based on content\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of this multi-agent approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on their area of expertise, providing more accurate and detailed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaboration**: Agents can work together to address complex queries that span multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordination**: The coordinator agent ensures a coherent user experience despite the complexity behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**: New specialized agents can be added to the system as needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Control**: Different termination and selection strategies allow for customized conversation flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enterprise Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-agent architecture has numerous practical applications in enterprise settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Route inquiries to specialized support agents based on query content\n",
    "- **IT Helpdesk**: Direct technical questions to the right support specialists\n",
    "- **Knowledge Management**: Create a team of experts that can answer questions about company documentation\n",
