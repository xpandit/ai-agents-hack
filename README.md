# AI Agents Hackathon

Welcome to the AI Agents Hackathon! This event is designed to help you learn about AI Agents, understand how they work, and build your own agentic AI solutions using modern frameworks.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of AI Agents and how they differ from traditional AI solutions
- How to use popular Agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, Azure AI Agent Service)
- Practical prompt engineering and evaluation techniques
- How to build single and multi-agent systems that can accomplish complex tasks
- Integrating AI Agents with other services like Azure AI Search
- Creating AI solutions that can use tools, reason through problems, and collaborate

## Hackathon Structure

This hackathon consists of 7 progressive challenges that will take you from the basics of AI Agents to building sophisticated multi-agent systems:

- **Challenge 0**: Setup and Environment Configuration
- **Challenge 1**: Introduction to AI Agents
- **Challenge 2**: Exploring Agentic AI Frameworks
- **Challenge 3**: Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering & Evaluation
- **Challenge 4**: Functions & Plugins with Semantic Kernel
- **Challenge 5**: Tool Usage & Agentic RAG
- **Challenge 6**: Building an AI Agent with Multiple Tools
- **Challenge 7**: Multi-Agent Collaboration with Semantic Kernel & AutoGen

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python is preferred)
- Azure subscription (for Azure AI services)
- GitHub account
- VS Code or preferred code editor

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Open a GitHub Codespace from the forked repository
3. Progress through each challenge sequentially, starting with [Challenge 0](challenge-0/README.md)
4. Each challenge has its own folder with a README.md containing instructions

## Challenge Overview

### Challenge 0 - Setup

Set up your development environment, get API keys, and ensure you have access to all necessary resources.

### Challenge 1 - Introduction to AI Agents

Learn what makes AI systems "agentic," understand the theory behind AI Agents, and explore their capabilities and limitations.

### Challenge 2 - Exploring Agentic AI Frameworks

Get hands-on with popular frameworks including AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and Azure AI Agent Service. Understand their architecture and when to use each.

### Challenge 3 - Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering & Evaluation

Master the art of writing effective prompts, use Prompty for interactive development, and apply Microsoft's tools to evaluate prompt quality.

### Challenge 4 - Functions & Plugins with Semantic Kernel

Learn how to extend AI capabilities by creating custom plugins, exposing functions to AI, and enabling more sophisticated interactions.

### Challenge 5 - Tool Usage & Agentic RAG

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an agentic approach, allowing AIs to search and use information in documents to accomplish tasks.

### Challenge 6 - Building an AI Agent with Multiple Tools

Create a specialized IT helpdesk agent that can use multiple tools to diagnose and resolve issues, with structured outputs for downstream systems.

### Challenge 7 - Multi-Agent Collaboration

Build a system where multiple specialized agents work together to solve complex problems, coordinating their efforts toward a common goal.
