# Challenge 7: Multi-Agent Collaboration with Semantic Kernel & AutoGen

Welcome to the last challenge of the AI Agents Hackathon! In this culminating challenge, you'll combine all the skills and concepts you've learned to build a sophisticated multi-agent system that leverages the power of both Semantic Kernel and AutoGen frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

- Master multi-agent architecture patterns and understand framework comparisons
- Implement effective communication protocols between collaborative specialized agents
- Create complex integrations involving multiple capabilities (RAG, function calling, task decomposition)
- Design agent orchestration systems that coordinate work between specialized agents
- Build a real-world, enterprise-ready AI solution that solves a practical business problem

## The Convergence of Frameworks

This challenge explores the exciting convergence of Microsoft's agentic AI frameworks. As announced by Microsoft, there are plans to align the multi-agent runtime in AutoGen with Semantic Kernel in early 2025, creating a unified approach for AI agent development.

While we await this official convergence, we can already leverage the strengths of both frameworks in complementary ways:

- **Semantic Kernel**: Excels at enterprise integration, plugin architecture, and production-ready deployments
- **AutoGen**: Specializes in research-oriented multi-agent conversations and collaborative agent design

## Employee Onboarding Assistant System

### Scenario

Imagine your company is growing rapidly and HR is struggling to handle the influx of new employee questions during onboarding. To solve this, you'll create a comprehensive Employee Onboarding Assistant System that consists of multiple specialized agents working together to provide a seamless experience for new hires.

### System Architecture

Your multi-agent system will feature:

1. **Coordinator Agent**: The central orchestrator that interacts directly with users, routes queries to specialized agents, and synthesizes final responses
   
2. **Specialized Sub-Agents**:
   - **IT Support Agent**: Handles technical setup questions and access requests (based on Challenge 6)
   - **HR Policy Agent**: Answers questions about company policies, benefits, and procedures using RAG (based on Challenge 5)
   - **Facilities Agent**: Manages office-related queries like desk assignments, building access, and equipment
   - **Training Agent**: Provides information about required training and development resources

3. **Utility Agents**:
   - **Research Agent**: Retrieves and summarizes information from company knowledge bases when needed
   - **Verification Agent**: Validates the accuracy of responses before they reach the user
   - **Reasoning Agent**: Helps decompose complex requests into manageable sub-tasks

### Communication Flows

Your system will implement sophisticated communication protocols:
- **Query routing**: Determining which agent(s) should handle a specific request
- **Information sharing**: Passing context and knowledge between agents
- **Consensus building**: Resolving conflicting information or recommendations
- **Response synthesis**: Creating cohesive answers from multiple agent inputs

## Implementation Options

This challenge offers two implementation paths:

### Option 1: Semantic Kernel Multi-Agent System

Use Semantic Kernel's agent framework to build a system where:
- Each agent is defined as a Semantic Kernel agent with specific instructions
- Agents communicate through a group chat orchestrator
- Plugins provide specialized capabilities to each agent
- Thread management maintains conversation context

### Option 2: AutoGen Multi-Agent System

Use AutoGen's collaborative agent framework to create:
- A multi-agent conversation group with specialized agent roles
- Custom agent state tracking and memory mechanisms
- Function calling for specialized tools and external services
- Advanced conversation flow control with conditional routing

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Advanced)

For those seeking an extra challenge, explore the integration of both frameworks:
- Use AutoGen for the agent conversation architecture
- Leverage Semantic Kernel for plugin development and enterprise integration
- Create bridge components that allow the frameworks to communicate
- Experiment with patterns that anticipate the planned framework convergence

## Getting Started

This challenge provides three Jupyter notebooks:

1. `semantic_kernel_solution.ipynb`: Implementation using Semantic Kernel's agent framework
2. `autogen_solution.ipynb`: Implementation using AutoGen's collaborative agents
3. `hybrid_solution.ipynb`: Advanced implementation combining both frameworks

Choose the approach that interests you most, or try multiple approaches to compare their strengths and limitations.

## Key Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Configure the frameworks and services
- Define agent roles and communication protocols
- Establish the core conversation architecture

### 2. Building Specialized Agents
- Implement each agent with specific domain knowledge and capabilities
- Create the necessary plugins or tools for each agent
- Design appropriate prompts and system messages

### 3. Developing Communication Mechanisms
- Implement message routing between agents
- Create protocols for sharing context and information
- Design consensus-building mechanisms for conflicting information

### 4. Integrating RAG Capabilities
- Connect agents to company knowledge bases
- Implement retrieval strategies for different document types
- Create relevance assessment mechanisms

### 5. Implementing User Interface
- Design conversation flows from the user perspective
- Create natural transitions between agent specialists
- Implement context preservation across the conversation

### 6. Testing and Refinement
- Evaluate the system with realistic onboarding scenarios
- Measure response quality, accuracy, and helpfulness
- Optimize prompt engineering and agent interactions

## Framework Integration Insights

Recent developments have shown promising ways to integrate Semantic Kernel and AutoGen:

### From Semantic Kernel to AutoGen
- Use Semantic Kernel plugins as custom tools in AutoGen agents
- Leverage Semantic Kernel's planner for high-level task decomposition in AutoGen
- Export Semantic Kernel agents as participants in AutoGen group chats

### From AutoGen to Semantic Kernel
- Use AutoGen's multi-agent conversation patterns within Semantic Kernel's framework
- Leverage AutoGen's research-oriented patterns for Semantic Kernel agent design
- Implement AutoGen's state tracking mechanisms in Semantic Kernel agents

## Challenge Success Criteria

Your Employee Onboarding Assistant System should:

- Correctly route user queries to the appropriate specialized agents
- Enable collaborative problem-solving between multiple agents
- Retrieve relevant information from knowledge bases when needed
- Generate helpful, accurate responses for common onboarding questions
- Handle complex queries that span multiple domains
- Present a coherent, seamless experience to the user, despite the complexity behind the scenes

## Sample Test Scenarios

Test your system with these realistic onboarding queries:

1. **Cross-domain query**: "I'm starting next Monday and need to know what to bring on my first day, how to get building access, and when I'll receive my laptop."

2. **Complex IT setup**: "I need help setting up my development environment with the right permissions to access the customer database for my project."

3. **Policy clarification**: "What's the company policy on remote work, and how do I request equipment for my home office?"

4. **Training requirements**: "Which mandatory training courses do I need to complete in my first week, and how do I access them?"

5. **Multi-step process**: "I need to set up direct deposit for my paycheck, choose my health insurance plan, and schedule my orientation. Where do I start?"

## Advanced Concepts (Bonus)

If you complete the main challenge, extend your system with:

- **Adaptive learning**: Agents that improve their responses based on user feedback
- **Memory mechanisms**: Long-term context tracking across multiple user sessions
- **Explanation capabilities**: Agents that can explain their reasoning and decision processes
- **Fallback strategies**: Elegant handling of edge cases and out-of-scope requests
- **Multi-modal support**: Incorporating images and document uploads into the conversation flow
