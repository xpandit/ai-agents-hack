    "# Challenge 4: Functions & Plugins with Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we'll explore Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework and learn how to create powerful AI agents by combining prompts with custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with programming languages. It provides a structured way to combine AI capabilities with custom code, external data sources, and API services.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Semantic Kernel powerful for building AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plugin Architecture**: Create reusable components that extend AI capabilities\n",
    "- **Function Calling**: Allow LLMs to invoke your custom code when needed\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration**: Combine AI prompts and traditional programming in a unified workflow\n",
    "- **Memory & Context Management**: Maintain state and manage conversation history\n",
    "- **Enterprise Readiness**: Designed for production applications with scalability in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel is the central orchestrator in Semantic Kernel. It:\n",
    "- Manages LLM connections and contexts\n",
    "- Handles function registration and execution\n",
    "- Coordinates plugins and their interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel supports two types of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Native Functions**: Traditional code (Python, C#, etc.) that performs specific tasks\n",
    "- **Semantic Functions**: AI prompt templates that guide the LLM to perform tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are collections of related functions (both native and semantic) that work together to provide specific capabilities."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we've explored the key features of Semantic Kernel that make it powerful for building AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Functions**: Creating reusable AI prompts as functions\n",
    "2. **Native Functions**: Integrating code with AI capabilities\n",
    "3. **Plugins**: Organizing related functions into logical groups\n",
    "4. **Function Calling**: Giving the AI the ability to call your functions when needed\n",
    "5. **Chat Context**: Maintaining conversation state across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our onboarding assistant demonstrates how Semantic Kernel can be used to build practical applications that combine AI with custom business logic. By structuring your application this way, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Easy to extend with new functions or plugins\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Components can be shared across different AI agents\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Clear separation between AI reasoning and business logic\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Changes to functions don't require retraining AI models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next challenge, we'll explore tool usage and agentic RAG, taking our AI assistant capabilities even further! "
