                "\n",

                "\n",
                "2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, unambiguous directions about what you want the AI to do. For instance, \"Explain the company's leave policy in simple language that new employees can easily understand.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "3. **Input/Output Format Specification**: Clearly define how to format inputs and expected outputs. For example, \"Present the information in a Q&A format with common questions new employees might have.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "4. **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide examples demonstrating desired input/output patterns to guide the AI's responses. For instance, giving an example of how a policy explanation should be structured.\n",
                "\n",
                "5. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guide the model through a reasoning process. For example, \"First explain the basic entitlement, then outline the procedure for requesting leave, and finally describe any special conditions.\"\n",
                "\n",
                "6. **System vs User Prompts**: Utilize system prompts for personality and user prompts for specific requests. For instance, setting the system prompt to establish the AI as an HR assistant, and using user prompts for specific policy questions.\n",
                "\n",
                "When creating prompts for HR policy explanation during employee onboarding, these principles help ensure that explanations are clear, consistent, and tailored to new employees' needs."
