    "# Challenge 5: Azure AI Agents SDK - Employee Onboarding & IT Support\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the Azure AI Agents SDK through a series of focused examples. Unlike the previous notebook that used Semantic Kernel, this one will leverage the Azure AI Agents SDK to create AI assistants with various capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples all revolve around employee onboarding and IT support, but each one focuses on a different capability of the Azure AI Agents SDK. You can run them independently and modify them to experiment with different aspects of the SDK.\n",

    "## What is Azure AI Agents SDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure AI Agents SDK is a client library that allows you to build and run AI agents in Azure. It provides capabilities to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create agents that can execute tasks and answer questions\n",
    "- Add tools like file search, code interpreter, and custom functions\n",
    "- Set up conversational threads to maintain context\n",
    "- Process runs to get agent responses\n",
    "- Track detailed run steps to understand agent behavior"
