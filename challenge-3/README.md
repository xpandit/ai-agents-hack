# Challenge 3: Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering & Evaluation

In this challenge, you'll master the art of writing effective prompts, explore interactive development techniques, and learn how to evaluate prompt quality using Microsoft's tools.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of effective prompt engineering
- Learn how prompt development and evaluation works in practice
- Explore Microsoft's prompt evaluation frameworks
- See examples of prompts for specific agent tasks
- Understand how prompt performance can be improved through systematic evaluation

## Getting Started

This challenge comes with a pre-prepared Jupyter notebook (`solution.ipynb`) that walks you through various aspects of prompt engineering and evaluation. **No coding required** - the notebook is ready to run, with clear explanations and examples at each step.

### Prerequisites

- Python environment with Jupyter support
- OpenAI API key (instructions for setup are in the notebook)
- Basic familiarity with Python

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Prompt Engineering Fundamentals
The notebook explains key principles of effective prompt engineering:
- Role & context setting
- Clear instructions
- Input/output format specification
- Few-shot examples
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- System vs User prompts

### 2. Interactive Prompt Development
The notebook demonstrates:
- Setting up a prompt testing environment
- Iterative prompt refinement techniques
- Visualization of prompt improvements

### 3. Prompt Scenarios & Examples
You'll explore real-world examples of prompts for:
- A research assistant that summarizes academic papers
- A code reviewer that provides feedback on code quality
- A data analyst that extracts insights from tables

### 4. Evaluation Methods
Learn about different approaches to evaluate your prompts:
- Microsoft's Prompt Flow framework
- Custom evaluation metrics
- A/B testing different prompt versions

### 5. Optimization Techniques
See practical examples of prompt optimization:
- Before/after comparisons
- Quantified improvements
- Best practices for systematic improvement

## How to Complete This Challenge

1. Open the `solution.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
2. Run through each cell in sequence
3. Read the explanations and observe the examples
4. Try modifying some of the example prompts to see how changes affect outputs
5. Complete any exercises marked as "Your Turn" in the notebook
