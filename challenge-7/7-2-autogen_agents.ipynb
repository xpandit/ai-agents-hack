    "# Challenge 7-2: Multi-Agent Collaboration with AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a multi-agent collaboration system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. Similar to our Semantic Kernel implementation, we'll create an Employee Onboarding Assistant System but this time using AutoGen's flexible agent communication patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen is a research-oriented framework maintained by Microsoft Research's AI Frontiers Lab, specializing in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced conversable agent design patterns\n",
    "- Flexible agent-to-agent communication protocols\n",
    "- Dynamic group chat orchestration with various topologies\n",
    "- Code execution and tool use within agent conversations\n",
    "- Cutting-edge research on agentic capabilities\n",
    "- Highly customizable agent behaviors and interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen focuses on enabling autonomous and collaborative problem-solving between multiple AI agents. The framework allows these agents to work together through conversation, execute code, use tools, and interact with humans when needed."

    "\n",
    "1. **Flexible Agent Communication**: AutoGen's GroupChat allows for dynamic interaction patterns between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Calling**: Agents can access structured information through function calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Speaker Selection**: The ability to control conversation flow with custom speaker selection logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalable Agent Teams**: Easy addition of new specialized agents to handle broader domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complex Workflows**: Support for sophisticated multi-step workflows spanning multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AutoGen framework is particularly well-suited for research and development of advanced agent interaction patterns, with its focus on flexible, collaborative problem-solving between agents.\n",
